# Bookmarklets

**Please [view these pages at jn64.github.io/bookmarklets](https://jn64.github.io/bookmarklets/)**

GitHub.com doesn't render the bookmarklet links in Markdown previews as they contain JavaScript.

Bookmarklets include:

- dictionary
- translation
- Internet Archive
- old/new Reddit
- page navigation
- linking in Markdown and other markup languages
